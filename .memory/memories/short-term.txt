## What Was Accomplished

Scraper improvements and cleanup:
- Fixed output buffering (line-buffered for tee compatibility)
- Added graceful CTRL-C handling
- Added required OUTPUT-PATH CLI argument with --help
- Renamed output dirs: Claude-API-and-Agent-SDK, MCP, Claude-Code
- Changed purge to only remove our directories (not entire output dir)
- Renamed script: scrape.py → scrape-ant-docs.py
- Updated CLAUDE.md with current state
- Archived completed plan, cleaned up notepads

## Repository State

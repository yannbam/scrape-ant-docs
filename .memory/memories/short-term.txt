# Session 44ee1bff - 2025-12-28

## What Was Accomplished

1. **Onboarding complete** - analyzed project structure, llms-txt-sources/, scraped-docs/

2. **Source comparison** (via 2 Opus agents):
   - llms.txt vs llms-full.txt: llms.txt preserves section structure, is complete
   - llms-full.txt loses section groupings, missing 1 doc on platform
   - Content semantically identical but formatted differently

3. **Decision: Use llms.txt** for URL extraction

4. **Directory structure decisions documented**:
   - platform: use URL paths directly (strip /docs/en/)
   - mcp: use URL paths directly (keep version dates)
   - code: derive from docs_map.md sections, unmapped→misc/
   - Only keep Python + TypeScript SDK examples (skip go/java/kotlin/ruby)

5. **Created SCRAPER-SPEC.md** - complete implementation specification

## Next Steps

- Implement scraper based on SCRAPER-SPEC.md
- The remaining plan task: "Update Scraper" (see plan "Scraper Source Decision")

## Repository State

- SCRAPER-SPEC.md: NEW (uncommitted)
- .plans/: updated (uncommitted)
- scrape-all-docs.sh: old version, needs rewrite

## Key Files

- SCRAPER-SPEC.md - implementation spec (START HERE)
- llms-txt-sources/ - raw source files for reference
- scraped-docs/ - output from old scraper (will be replaced)

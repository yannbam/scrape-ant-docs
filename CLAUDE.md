# Anthropic Documentation Scraper

## Purpose

Scrape all available Anthropic documentation into a local copy with a directory structure and filenames that are **immediately navigable by Claude Code or agents**.

The goal: Claude can run `ls` on the scraped output, see the structure and filenames, and know exactly where to find specific documentation without grep/search guesswork.

## Current State

**`scrape-all-docs.sh`** - Working scraper that downloads from all three llms.txt sources:
- platform.claude.com (~530 pages) - Anthropic API/SDK docs
- modelcontextprotocol.io (~47 pages) - MCP docs
- code.claude.com (~52 pages) - Claude Code docs

Outputs to `scraped-docs/` (gitignored). Purges output dir before each run.

**`llms-txt-sources/`** - Manually downloaded snapshot of the raw source files for reference/analysis. Not auto-generated.

## Open Questions

### 1. llms.txt vs llms-full.txt

- `llms.txt` provides URL index → requires fetching each .md file individually (current approach)
- `llms-full.txt` contains all content inline → could parse/split programmatically

Both produce identical content. Trade-off: network calls vs parsing complexity.

### 2. Optimal Directory Structure

The structure must be:
- Programmatically extractable from the sources
- Self-documenting (Claude understands organization from filenames alone)
- Consistent across all three doc sources

Current approach flattens paths with underscores (`agent-sdk/overview.md` → `agent-sdk_overview.md`). Is hierarchical better?

**Path depth by source:**
| Source | Depth | Example |
|--------|-------|---------|
| platform.claude.com | Deep | `agent-sdk/overview.md`, `build-with-claude/prompt-engineering/chain-prompts.md` |
| code.claude.com | Flat | `hooks.md`, `overview.md` |
| modelcontextprotocol.io | Mixed | `specification/basic/lifecycle.md` |

### 3. claude_code_docs_map.md

Found at `code.claude.com/docs/en/claude_code_docs_map.md`. Auto-generated by GitHub Actions (per header).

Contains:
- Section groupings (e.g., "Getting started", "Configuration")
- Heading hierarchy within each page

**Open question:** Does this contain organizational structure that llms.txt/llms-full.txt lack? Could inform better directory structure or filename prefixes for the Claude Code docs.
